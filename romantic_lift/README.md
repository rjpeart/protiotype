Originally I was trying to find a way to use a phone as an ad-hoc stylus, and project the drawing process on a wall. But the accelerometer is nowhere near accurate enough for detailed drawings. However, I kinda liked the weird, counter-intuitive drawing method it forced, so I built it into Dumb Draw.
